# Contributing to DEBT

As an open source project, DEBT welcomes contributions of many forms.

## Bug reporting

The bug tracker is currently [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/issues). When DEBT has progressed far enough, we will start [self-hosting DEBT issues on DEBT itself](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/issues/22).

Please search through the existing issues prior to filing a new issue.

## New features

All new features should start as a discussion in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/issues).

## Patch submission

Patches are welcome as [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/pulls). Please include a Signed-off-by line in your commit message. Note that by submitting patches with the Signed-off-by line, you are giving permission to license the patch as MIT. See the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/debt/blob/master/DCO.md) for details.

## Documentation

There are currently no tutorials or API documentation. When DEBT is approaching the point of becoming a minimally viable product, we will start writing documentation. If you're interested in helping with this, please contact Scott Gonz√°lez at scott.gonzalez@gmail.com or file an issue.
